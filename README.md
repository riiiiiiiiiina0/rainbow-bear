## Why Rainbow Bear?

- **One single purpose**: Improve Notion‚Äôs highlight colors so important ideas stand out.
- **Vivid and readable**: Brighter, clearer highlight backgrounds with appropriate text contrast.
- **Color‚Äëblind friendly**: Optional gentle patterns layer on top of colors to help differentiate hues.
- **Customize your palette**: Pick your own background and text color per Notion highlight color.
- **Optional animations**: Subtle, soft animations you can turn on to draw the eye (off by default).
- **Dark/light aware**: Works nicely with both Notion themes.
- **Private and lightweight**: Uses only `storage` permission. No analytics, no tracking, no network calls.

## How it works (peek under the hood)

- The extension injects CSS variables and styles to replace Notion‚Äôs default highlight swatches.
- Your color choices and toggles are saved via `chrome.storage.sync`.
- Changes apply instantly across all Notion tabs and survive refreshes.

Key files if you‚Äôre curious:

- `styles.css` ‚Äî base highlight rules and optional animation keyframes.
- `content_script.js` ‚Äî applies styles and reacts to saved setting changes.
- `options.html` + `options.js` ‚Äî a friendly panel to pick colors and toggles.

## If Notion changes break highlight colors

If Notion updates its internal styles and the extension stops matching highlight colors, refresh the CSS using this workflow:

1. Export the Notion test page as HTML: [Highlight color test](https://www.notion.so/triiii/Highlight-color-test-26c7aa7407c18044bd2cd493593253ba). There is an example copy in the `docs` folder: `docs/Highlight color test (exported from notion).html`.
2. In Cursor, open a chat for this repo and paste this prompt (replace `@xxx.html` with your exported file path if different):

```
the original highlight colors on notion page has changed, please read the latest values from @docs/Highlight color test (exported from notion).html, then update the corresponding css values in @styles.css
```

3. Review the proposed edits and apply them. Reload the unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions` if needed.
