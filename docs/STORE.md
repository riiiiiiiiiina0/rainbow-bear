Make Notion highlights vivid, readable, and color‑blind friendly. Custom colors, optional animations, and gentle patterns.

—

## Overview

Rainbow Bear has a single mission: make highlights in Notion more vivid, more readable, and more friendly for color‑blind users. It brightens your existing highlight colors, lets you fine‑tune the palette, and adds optional patterns to help distinguish similar hues — all without changing how you use Notion.

## What you’ll love

- Vivid, readable highlights: Brighter backgrounds with clear contrast so key ideas stand out.
- Color‑blind friendly mode: Add gentle patterns on top of colors for easier differentiation.
- Customize your palette: Choose background and text color for each Notion highlight color.
- Optional animations: Subtle, soft animations you can enable to gently draw attention.
- Works with light and dark: Looks great in both Notion themes.
- Private and lightweight: Only uses `storage` permission. No tracking, no analytics.

## How it works

- Rainbow Bear updates Notion’s highlight styles on the page with improved colors and contrast.
- Your choices are saved so they persist across tabs and sessions.
- Turn on Color‑blind Mode any time for patterned highlights that remain readable.

## Getting started

1. Install Rainbow Bear.
2. Open Notion and highlight text as usual — colors are automatically improved.
3. Open the extension’s Options to tweak colors, enable Color‑blind Mode, or add animations.

## Permissions

## Privacy

Rainbow Bear does not collect or transmit personal data.
